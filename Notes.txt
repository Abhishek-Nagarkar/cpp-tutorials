Pass by Value and Return by Value ==> New variable is created which is 
cheap to copy if it is of primitive type (expensive for class type)

Eg. std::string returnByValue();
expensive since copy of string will be created and returned to the caller

To resolve this issue : Pass by (const) reference or pass by address

Keep in mind -> when returning by reference make sure the object is not bound 
to function scope
